### ppp2nd_dumper.py

This tool lets you dump all data from a ParaParaParadise 2nd Mix HDD with proper filenames. The checksum algorithm is also documented but not used, but it could be useful for anyone wanting to modify data. The only file that is not properly named is filename hash `90547703` which is the bootloader.

```
usage: ppp2nd_dumper.py [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input file
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output folder
```
